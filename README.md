# MMM-HomeKit
### Help needed!
I need help testing the module with different Homekit configurations and ["Apple bridges"](https://support.apple.com/es-es/guide/watch/apd1af68cb2a/watchos#:~:text=Allow%20remote%20access,it%20will%20be%20paired%20automatically.). The accessories and handlers work perfectly, the last touches regarding acting on events and other QOL is what is still in development.

Only accessories and backend handlers are finished.
